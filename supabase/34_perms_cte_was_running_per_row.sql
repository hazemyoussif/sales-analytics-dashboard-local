-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE on product_facts over a one-month window, after file 33:
--
--   velocity append            1.768 ms
--   period_agg aggregate       1.316 ms
--   dashboard_products scan    1.290 ms
--   dashboard_stock scan       0.171 ms
--   lastsale scan              0.156 ms
--   invoice-line branches      never executed
--   ---------------------------------------
--   Execution Time         2,317.058 ms
--
-- Every node that touches data finishes inside seven milliseconds, nothing
-- reads from disk, and the query still takes two and a third seconds. The top
-- node is "actual time=12.026..2315.944 rows=1296": first row at 12ms, last at
-- 2,316ms, while all of its inputs were finished at 6ms. Two point three
-- seconds to emit 1,296 rows that were already computed.
--
-- The plan names "CTE filtered" and "CTE use_cached" as nodes. There is no
-- "CTE perms" node. Postgres inlined it -- so app_my_hidden_columns() and
-- app_table_visible() are evaluated ONCE PER OUTPUT ROW inside the select
-- list, not once for the statement. Roughly 3,900 calls to a security-definer
-- function that reads app_users and app_roles every time.
--
-- That is also why the cost never moved with the window size: 1 month and 27
-- months both emit ~1,296 rows, and the price is per row, not per month.
--
-- STABLE does not prevent this. It permits caching; it does not promise it,
-- and here the planner chose not to. MATERIALIZED is the promise: the CTE is
-- computed once and the three function calls happen once.
--
-- Fixed here for product_facts alone, on purpose -- it is the worst case and
-- the one on every page. The same pattern is in about fifteen other RPCs and
-- they get the same treatment once this is measured rather than assumed.
--
-- Run in: Supabase -> SQL Editor. Safe to re-run.
